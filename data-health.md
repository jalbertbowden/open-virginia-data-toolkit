Maps and Geographic Information Systems

This list provides links to maps and geographic information system (GIS) resources that may be of interest to cancer epidemiologists, but is not exhaustive. Access to resources is dependent on procedures outlined for each individual resource. Availability of data may depend on suitability of proposed research, collaboration with study investigators, ethical considerations, or approval from a steering committee.

State Cancer ProfilesExternal Web Site Policy  
A system to characterize the cancer burden in a standardized manner in order to motivate action, integrate surveillance into cancer control planning, characterize areas and demographic groups, and expose health disparities. The focus is on cancer sites for which there are evidence based control interventions. Epidemiologists may find this site useful for exploring cancer statistics to identify research opportunities.  
Cancer Mortality Maps & GraphsExternal Web Site Policy  
This Website provides dynamically generated maps for the time period 1950-2004 (1970-2004 only for Blacks).  
Geographic Information Systems and Science for Cancer Prevention and ControlExternal Web Site Policy
