<blockquote>
Did You Know?

    In March 2011 Thomas E. Mann, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, and Norman J. Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, both judges of the Virginia redistricting college competition, wrote in the Washington Post, “Saslaw (Senator Richard Saslaw  D-Springfield) described a classic bipartisan incumbent gerrymander: the majority Democrats in the state Senate would let the majority Republicans in the state House stack the deck for its incumbents and vice versa. The biggest losers? The voters of Virginia, denied competitive elections in which the outcomes reflect their collective preferences.”

Gerrymander Jeremiads
A hardy perennial in Virginia politics is the ritualistic denunciation of gerrymandering. Sure, redistricting is unfair. But none of the alternatives looks any better.
