  <h2>Costs</h2>
  <p>The County may make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying, or searching for the requested records. The County shall not impose any extraneous, intermediary, or surplus fees or expenses to recoup the general costs associated with creating or maintaining records or transacting the general business of the County. Any duplicating fee charged by the County shall not exceed the actual cost of duplication.
The requestor may have to pay for the records that are requested from the County.  FOIA allows the County to charge for the actual costs of responding to FOIA requests.  This would include items such as staff time spent searching for the requested records, copying costs, or any other costs directly related to supplying the requested records.  It cannot include general overhead costs.
If the County estimates that it will cost more than $200 to respond to a request, the County may require the requestor to pay a deposit, not to exceed the amount of the estimate, before proceeding with the request.  The five day response time for a request does not include the time between when the County asks for a deposit and when the requestor responds to the County.
The requestor may request that the County estimate in advance the charges for supplying the records that have been requested.  This will allow the requestor to know about any costs upfront, or give the requestor an opportunity to modify the request in an attempt to lower the estimated costs.
If the requestor owes the County money from a previous FOIA request that has remained unpaid for more than 30 days, the County may require payment of the past-due bill before it will respond to the new FOIA request.
