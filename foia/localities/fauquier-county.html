  <h2>Costs</h2>
  Costs:

    A public body may make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying, searching for, or reviewing the requested records. No public body shall impose any extraneous, intermediary, or surplus fees or expenses to recoup the general costs associated with creating or maintaining records or transacting the general business of the public body. Any duplicating fee charged by a public body shall not exceed the actual cost of duplication. All charges for the supplying of requested records shall be estimated in advance at the request of the citizen as set forth in subsection F of § 2.2-3704 of the Code of Virginia.

    Duplicating costs are calculated as follows:

    A charge of $0.10 (ten cents) per printed side of a page for black and white 8 ½ x 11 or 8 ½ x 14 paper copies (in other words: $0.20 per sheet of paper if printed on both sides) and $0.50 (fifty cents) per printed side of a page for color copies ($1.00 per page if printed on both sides); or

    $0.50 (fifty cents) per CD-ROM. If any other media or non-standard paper size is used, the requestor shall not be charged more than the County’s actual cost.

    If, due to the size or format, the responding department does not have the ability to duplicate the public records requested and the requesting party cannot review the records in the County offices, an outside vendor may be used to make copies only if the requesting party agrees to the arrangement and pays the full cost to the vendor directly.

    You may have to pay for the records that you request from Fauquier County. FOIA allows us to charge for the actual costs of responding to FOIA requests. This would include items like staff time spent searching for the requested records, copying costs, or any other costs directly related to supplying the requested records. It cannot include general overhead costs.

    If we estimate that it will cost more than $200 to respond to your request, you will be required to pay a deposit in the full amount of the estimate before staff proceeds with producing records responsive to your request. The five days that we have to respond to your request does not include the time between when we ask for a deposit and when you respond.

    You may request that we estimate in advance the charges for supplying the records that you have requested. This will allow you to know about any costs upfront, or give you the opportunity to modify your request in an attempt to lower the estimated costs.

    If you owe us money from a previous FOIA request that has remained unpaid for more than 30 days, Fauquier County may require payment of the past-due bill before it will respond to your new FOIA request.
