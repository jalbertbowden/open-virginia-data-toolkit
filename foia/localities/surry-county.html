  <h2>COSTS OF REQUESTING FOIA RECORDS:

You may be requested to pay for the records that you request.  FOIA allows the County to charge for the actual costs of responding to your FOIA request including staff time spent searching for the requested records, copying costs, or any other costs directly related to supplying the requested records.  Charges can, and should be, requested in advance pursuant to the Code of Virginia 2.2-3704.  In the event that costs of supplying the records exceed $200, we may require that you make a deposit before proceeding with your request.  (The five days that we have to respond to your request does not include the time between when we ask for a deposit and when you respond.)  Costs are expected to be paid upon receipt of the records.   

 

TYPES OF RECORDS:

The County and its Departments generally maintain Personnel records pertaining to employees and officials of the County, records of Contracts which the County has entered into, Land Development Records and Inspections (building, zoning and environmental), Performance Surety Agreements, Building Plans, Utility Plans, Site Plans and Environmental Plans, and Financial Documents.
