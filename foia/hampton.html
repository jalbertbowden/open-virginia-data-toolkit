Federal tax returns and return information (Internal Revenue Code § 6103 (a)) and Virginia Code § 58.1-3
Code of Virginia § 58.1-3 imposes stiff penalties on any person who discloses confidential taxpayer information. However, there is nothing in § 58.1-3 that prohibits the disclosure of confidential taxpayer information to the subject taxpayer. In other words, you may request and receive copies of your own tax returns. 
Also pursuant to Va. Code § 58.1-3, the Department cannot furnish aggregated tax information, by category, when the number of taxpayers within the category is minimal enough to potentially allow identification of the taxpayers.
