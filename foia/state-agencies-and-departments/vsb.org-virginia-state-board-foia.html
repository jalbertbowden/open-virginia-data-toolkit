<h2>Costs</h2>
A public body may make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying, or searching for the requested records. No public body shall impose any extraneous, intermediary, or surplus fees or expenses to recoup the general costs associated with creating or maintaining records or transacting the general business of the public body. Any duplicating fee charged by a public body shall not exceed the actual cost of duplication. All charges for supplying requested records shall be estimated in advance at the request of the citizen as set forth in subsection F of § 2.2-3704 of the Code of Virginia.
You may have to pay for the records that you request from the Virginia State Bar. FOIA allows us to charge for the actual costs of responding to FOIA requests. This would include items like staff time spent searching for the requested records, copying costs, or any other costs directly related to supplying the requested records. It cannot include general overhead costs.
If we estimate that it will cost more than $200 to respond to your request, we may require you to pay a deposit, not to exceed the amount of the estimate, before proceeding with your request. The five days that we have to respond to your request does not include the time between when we ask for a deposit and when you respond.
You may request that we estimate in advance the charges for supplying the records that you have requested.  This will allow you to know about any costs upfront, or give you the opportunity to modify your request in an attempt to lower the estimated costs.
If you owe us money from a previous FOIA request that has remained unpaid for more than thirty days, the Virginia State Bar may require payment of the past-due bill before it will respond to your new FOIA request.

Policy Regarding the Use of Exemptions
The Virginia State Bar invokes the above exemptions, including those exemptions that exist in the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, as necessary to protect the confidentiality of the disciplinary system and ethics committee deliberations and informal staff opinions. The Virginia State Bar balances its obligations under FOIA with its statutory obligations and its duties as set forth at the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia.
