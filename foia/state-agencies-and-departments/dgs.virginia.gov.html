  <h2>Costs</h2>
  A public body may make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual costs incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying, or searching for the requested records.  No public body shall impose any extraneous, intermediary, or surplus fees or expenses to recoup the general costs associated with creating or maintaining records or transacting the general business of the public body.  Any duplicating fees charged by the department shall not exceed the actual cost of duplication.  All charges for supplying of requested records shall be estimated in advance at the request of the citizen as set forth in subsection F of § 2.2-3704 of the Code of Virginia.  If a request is estimated to cost more than $200, a deposit may be required before proceeding with the request.  The five days to respond to the request does not include the time between asking for a deposit and the requester’s response.

A requester may request, in advance, an estimate of the charges.  If a requester owes the Department of General Services for a previous FOIA request and it has remained unpaid for more than 30 days the Department of General Services may require payment of the past-due bill before responding to the new FOIA request.
