Costs

    You may have to pay for the records you request from the VTC. FOIA allows us to charge for the actual costs of responding to FOIA requests. This would include items like staff time spent searching for the requested records, copying costs, or any other costs directly related to supplying the requested records. It cannot include general overhead costs.

    If we estimate that it will cost more than $200 to respond to your request, we may require you to pay a deposit. The deposit may be up to the amount of the estimate. The five days we have to respond to your request does not include the time between when we ask for a deposit and when you respond.

    You may request that we estimate in advance the charges for supplying the records you have requested. This will allow you to know about any costs upfront, or give you the opportunity to modify your request in an attempt to lower the estimated costs.

    If you have made a prior FOIA request that remains unpaid for more than 30 days, the VTC may require payment of that amount before we process your new request.
