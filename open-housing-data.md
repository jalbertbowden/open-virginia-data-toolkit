[Housing Affordability Sourcebook](http://www.vchr.vt.edu/housing-affordability-sourcebook/)  
The Housing Affordability Sourcebook serves as an online source of current housing affordability information for Virginia, including its MSAs and counties and independent cities. The Sourcebook allows users to determine for an area how housing costs compare to incomes, how housing affordability has changed over time, and how housing affordability compares to other areas. The Sourcebook reflects a joint effort of Housing Virginia, the Virginia Association of REALTORS’, and the Virginia Center for Housing Research. The Center’s contribution is the content including the design, calculation, and description of measures. The information provided by the Housing Affordability Sourcebook is critical in helping policy makers, housing advocates, economic developers, and realtors gauge housing affordability in their area.
